# Physics-Informed-Neural-Network-PINNs---TF-2.0

Physics Informed Neural Network for 1-D Burgers' equation implemented using the Sequential API in Tensorflow 2.0. Originally, the code was implemented by Raissi et. al. using Tensorflow 1.0 which is slightly difficult to interpret for people without a coding background. Tensorflow 2.0 comes embedded with Keras, a High Level API that makes Machine Learning user friendly. There are three ways of implementation in Tensorflow 2.0

1. Sequential API
2. Functional API
3. Sub-classed API

These are mentioned in the order to complexity.
