# Physics-Informed-Neural-Network-PINNs---TF-2.0

Physics Informed Neural Network for 1-D Burgers' equation implemented using the Sequential API in Tensorflow 2.0. Originally, the code was implemented by Raissi et. al. using Tensorflow 1.0 which is slightly difficult to interpret for people without a coding background. In contrast, Tensorflow 2.0 comes inbuilt with Keras, a High Level API that makes Machine Learning user friendly. 

Primarily, there are three ways of implementation using Tensorflow 2.0

1. Sequential API- High level API for hidden layers connected in series.
2. Functional API- High level API for multiple inputs/outputs or parallel arrangment of hidden layers.
3. Sub-classed API- Low level API. Implementation from scratch. 

These are mentioned in the order to complexity. For the problem at hand, Sequential API is sufficient.
